**Software Type**: API/Library (Confidence: 95%)

The `ghupdate` library provides a robust and flexible solution for Go applications to self-update directly from GitHub releases. It streamlines the process of checking for newer versions, downloading the correct binary for the user's operating system and architecture, and performing an atomic, in-place replacement of the currently running executable.

This library is built for resilience, managing temporary files, gracefully handling error conditions, and seamlessly integrating into your application's startup flow, offering a truly hands-off update experience for your users.
