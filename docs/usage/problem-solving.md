# Problem Solving

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

This section addresses common problems encountered when integrating and using `ghupdate`.

#### 1. "Error checking for update: failed to find matching asset"

*   **Cause**: The `AssetPattern` in your `UpdateConfig` does not accurately describe the file names of the assets in your GitHub release. This is the most common issue.
*   **Diagnosis**: 
    1.  Go to your GitHub release page and note the exact file names of your binaries (e.g., `mycli-v1.0.0-linux-amd64`, `mycli-v1.0.0-windows-amd64.exe`).
    2.  Compare these names against the pattern you provided in `config.AssetPattern`. Remember `ghupdate` replaces `{version}`, `{os}`, `{arch}`, `{ext}` placeholders.
    3.  Ensure the release is *not* a `draft` or `prerelease` (unless you're using a custom GitHub API call to fetch those, which `ghupdate` doesn't do by default for `releases/latest`).
*   **Solution**: Adjust your `AssetPattern` to precisely match the naming convention of your uploaded release assets. For example, if your asset is named `my-app-v1.2.3-linux-amd64`, your pattern should be `my-app-{version}-{os}-{arch}`.

#### 2. "GitHub API returned status 403" or "API rate limit exceeded"

*   **Cause**: You have hit GitHub's API rate limits (for unauthenticated requests, typically 60 requests per hour), or you are trying to access a private repository without providing a valid `GitHubToken`.
*   **Diagnosis**: 
    1.  Check if you're making too many requests (e.g., checking for updates on every application launch for many users).
    2.  Verify if `os.Getenv("GITHUB_TOKEN")` is returning an empty string when it shouldn't be.
    3.  If accessing a private repository, ensure your GitHub PAT has the `repo` scope enabled.
*   **Solution**: 
    1.  Provide a `GitHubToken` in your `UpdateConfig`. It's good practice even for public repositories to increase the rate limit to 5000 requests per hour.
    2.  Adjust your update check frequency to be less aggressive (e.g., once a day, or on user command).

#### 3. "Permission denied" during `ApplyUpdate` or `CleanupUpdate`

*   **Cause**: The application lacks the necessary write permissions to the `DataDir` (for temporary files) or the `ExecutablePath` (for the final replacement).
*   **Diagnosis**: 
    1.  Check the permissions of the directory specified in `config.DataDir`. This should typically be a user-writable location like `os.UserCacheDir()` or `os.UserConfigDir()`.
    2.  Check the permissions of the `ExecutablePath`. If your application is installed in a system-wide location (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` on Linux, `Program Files` on Windows), standard users might not have write permissions to overwrite the binary directly.
*   **Solution**: 
    1.  Ensure `DataDir` is set to a user-writable location, such as one returned by `os.UserCacheDir()`.
    2.  If the application is installed in a privileged location, consider deploying updates through a system package manager or an installer that handles privilege elevation, as `ghupdate` is primarily designed for user-writable locations. For CLI tools, encouraging users to install into `~/bin` or similar user-owned paths is common.

#### 4. Application Doesn't Update, or `HandleUpdateMode()` Isn't Called

*   **Cause**: The `ghupdate.HandleUpdateMode()` function is not being called as the *very first* executable statement in your `main` function, or the `ApplyUpdate` process failed to correctly spawn the new process with the required arguments.
*   **Diagnosis**: 
    1.  Inspect your `main` function to confirm `if ghupdate.HandleUpdateMode() { ... }` is the first line of code.
    2.  Check `ApplyUpdate`'s error logs (if any are returned) from the previous run to see if the new process failed to start.
*   **Solution**: Always ensure `if ghupdate.HandleUpdateMode() { ... }` is the absolute first thing that happens in your `main()` function, even before any logging or path determination. `ApplyUpdate` is designed to be robust in spawning the new process; issues here usually point to fundamental system problems.
